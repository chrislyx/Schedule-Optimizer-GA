# Using Genetic Algorithm to generate optimized schedule of meetings within the organization

For technical professionals, meetings can be disruptive to productivity because they tend to lead to schedule fragmentation, breaking up free time into chunks that are too small to acquire the focus needed to solve difficult problems or accomplish deep work. The goal of this project is to try and maximize productivity by optimizing different individuals' work schedule using a designed fitness function that ranks generated schedules based on number of contiguous blocks of free time.
